# MongoDB $inc Operator Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The bug arises from attempting to increment a field that does not exist or is not properly structured, leading to unexpected results or errors.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet incorrectly uses the `$inc` operator to increment a field that may not exist in the document or has an incorrect data type. This can result in the update failing silently or producing unintended consequences.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying the field's existence and data type before attempting the increment operation.  This may involve using conditional operators or checking data types.  The corrected code provides a robust solution that handles potential issues gracefully.

## How to reproduce
Clone this repository and run the `bug.js` script to observe the erroneous behavior. Then, compare it against the results from `bugSolution.js` to see the correct operation.
